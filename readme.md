#Lúmë Ardaron

Lúmë Ardaron is a project aiming to reproduce J.R.R. Tolkien's calendar reckonings.

The dates displayed in this project are calculated based on several books authored by Tolkien and the accuracy of these is disputed.

For the calculations to take place one must first root for a starting point in time. In this project, the starting point is the first of January of the year 1 CE. The algorithm calculates all dates using the Gregorian calendar and all changes from the Julian Calendar are ignored.

There are already two reckonings in this project: Rivendell Reckoning and the Shire Reckoning as it is used in the Third Age.

The aim is to add more reckonings in the near future, namely:

* The King's Reckoning (as used in Númenor, Gondor and Arnor)
* The Steward's Reckoning (as used in Gondor)
* The New Reckoning (as used in the 4th Age)
* The Dwarves Reckoning (lunar Calendar)

The content is being displayed in English, Quenya and Sindarin in decimal and duodecimal systems.

The dates may be slightly different from other sources. Usually the reason is the starting point chosen in this project.

For any suggesttions and questions, please contact the author.

For any issues found in the logic (missing day, duplicated day, etc), please fill in a bug report.
