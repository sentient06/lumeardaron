<h1>Lúmë Ardaron</h1>

<p>Lúmë Ardaron is a project aiming to reproduce J.R.R. Tolkien’s calendar reckonings.</p>

<p>The dates displayed in this project are calculated based on several books authored by Tolkien and the accuracy of these is disputed.</p>

<p>For the calculations to take place one must first root for a starting point in time. In this project, the starting point is the first of January of the year 1 CE. The algorithm calculates all dates using the Gregorian calendar and all changes from the Julian Calendar are ignored.</p>

<p>There are already two reckonings in this project: Rivendell Reckoning and the Shire Reckoning as it is used in the Third Age.</p>

<p>The aim is to add more reckonings in the near future, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The King’s Reckoning (as used in Númenor, Gondor and Arnor)</li>
  <li>The Steward’s Reckoning (as used in Gondor)</li>
  <li>The New Reckoning (as used in the 4th Age)</li>
  <li>The Dwarves Reckoning (lunar Calendar)</li>
</ul>

<p>The content is being displayed in English, Quenya and Sindarin in decimal and duodecimal systems.</p>

<p>The dates may be slightly different from other sources. Usually the reason is the starting point chosen in this project.</p>

<p>For any suggesttions and questions, please contact the author.</p>

<p>For any issues found in the logic (missing day, duplicated day, etc), please fill in a bug report.</p>
